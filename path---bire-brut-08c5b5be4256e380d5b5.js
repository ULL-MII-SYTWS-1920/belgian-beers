The 75-cl bottles are regularly rotated a quarter turn and slightly tilted until all the yeast collects in the neck of the bottle. The yeast is then frozen and removed, and the bottle is topped up again. The result is a very sparkling beer (e.g. Deus, Malheur Brut, etc.), blonde or dark."}},pathContext:{slug:"bire-brut"}}}});
