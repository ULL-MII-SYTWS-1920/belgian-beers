The use of the lighter beer (or even water) and of substandard lambic in the blend made this a cheap, light, sweet beer for everyday use. The sugar was originally added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage and gave it a sweet taste."}},pathContext:{slug:"faro"}}}});
