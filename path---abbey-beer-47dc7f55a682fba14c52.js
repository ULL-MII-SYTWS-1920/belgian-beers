The beer doesn’t have to be brewed in or in the neighborhood of the abbey but there has to be a demonstrable, historical connection with the abbey site the beer refers to. Further on the brewery has to pay royalties to the abbey and the abbey may also check the marketing strategy and publicity material. \nIn order to guarantee the name is not misused for marketing purposes, the breweries and religious orders have created an authenticity logo, which reads Erkend Belgisch Abdijbier (Recognised Belgian Abbey Beer, see www.belgianbrewers.be). In order to use the logo the beers have to comply with a minimum of conditions. It’s a Belgian label and only applies to Belgian beer. \nGood to know is that every Trappist beer also is an Abbey beer as the conditions to wear the Authentic Trappist Product logo are stricter than the ones for an Abbey beer. The other way on isn’t through as Abbey beers do not have to be brewed close to an active monastery. Even though drinking an Abbey beer is also bit of a good action as the royalties paid by the brewery go to cultural and/or charitable activities."}},pathContext:{slug:"abbey-beer"}}}});
